/*
 * Wraps Pottery's intro_sort in a C++ template.
 *
 * Use pottery::intro_sort() as a mostly drop-in replacement for std::sort()
 * with one caveat:
 *
 * - Throwing move and throwing swap are not supported. If a move constructor
 *   or swap throws, the program aborts. It is strongly recommended that your
 *   move constructor be marked noexcept.
 *
 * Introsort is a good general-purpose sorting algorithm. The downsides are
 * that it does not preserve order of equal elements (i.e. it is not "stable"),
 * it is not faster on arrays that are already mostly sorted, and it has a
 * fairly large code size (roughly 2kb of optimized machine code on x86_64.)
