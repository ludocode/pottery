This is the Pottery test suite.

You don't need to build or run the tests to use Pottery. It's a header-only library. Just put it on your include path.



## Scripts

Scripts should be run from the root of the repository. The tools under `test/tools/` are not meant to be run directly; they are used by the scripts below.

The following scripts are available for UNIX systems:

- `test/unit.sh` - Build and run unit tests.
- `test/fuzz.sh` - Build a fuzz testing harness for a particular algorithm or container and run it under american fuzzy lop.
- `test/benchmark.sh` - Download competing libraries and build and run some basic benchmarks.
- `test/scan-build.sh` - Run Clang Static Analyzer on the unit test suite.
- `test/clean.sh` - Clean the build folder.
- `test/examples.sh` - Build and run all examples.

The following scripts are available for Windows:

- `test\unit.bat` - Build and run unit tests with the Visual Studio Build Tools.
- `test\clean.bat` - Clean the build folder.



## Unit Tests

The unit test suite requires [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org/) and [**Ninja**](https://ninja-build.org/) on your `PATH`. On Windows, Ninja comes with the latest Visual Studio Build Tools but you'll need to [install Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Make sure to check the box to add it to your PATH during installation. On Linux, you can find Python 3 and Ninja in your distribution's package manager.

The unit test suite is run with `test/unit.sh` or `test\unit.bat`. Set "CC" to choose a compiler or leave it unset to use `cc` or `cl`. Pass a configuration to run or leave it blank to run the default. You can also pass "all" to run all supported configurations or "more" to run a small set of configurations likely to find bugs. For example:

```sh
CC=clang test/unit.sh more
```

The unit test suite supports various configurations. For example "c++17" compiles all source files as C++17 and "gnu89" compiles all source files as gnu89. Prefix the configuration with "run-" to run the tests, and suffix it with "-debug" or "-release" to choose debug or release builds. Pass multiple commands to run all of them. For example:

```sh
test/unit.sh run-{default,c++17,gnu89}-{debug,release}
```

The unit test suite also includes all examples in the `examples/` folder (except for Clayfish) as well as all fuzz tests in the `test/src/fuzz/` folder. The only code in the repository excluded from the unit test suite is the benchmark code under `test/src/pottery/benchmark/`.

When building the examples as unit tests, Pottery converts the `main()` function into a unit test and disables print statements and some warnings. This hides all unit test code from the examples, keeping them simple and runnable as standalone binaries.

When building the fuzz tests as unit tests, Pottery just generates a few kilobytes of random input to each of them over a number of rounds. The random seed is printed so you can reproduce bugs. See the [Fuzz Tests](#fuzz-tests) section below.

The unit test suite is itself made up of a bunch of test templates. For example the template [`test_pottery_array_ufo.t.h`](test/src/pottery/unit/test_pottery_array_ufo.t.h) tests a generalized array of `ufo_t`, a common test object. This template is instantiated to test vector, ring, pager, etc.



## Fuzz Tests

Pottery's algorithms and containers are fuzz tested. These can be run with [american fuzzy lop](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) to find bugs. They are also run as part of the unit test suite.

A fuzz test takes a byte stream as input and interprets it as a sequence of insertions, deletions, and other commands to perform on a data structure. The test also builds up a shadow data structure that repeats the commands performed on the real one. After each command, it checks the invariants of the data structure (such as tree balance) and checks that the data matches the shadow. The general idea is described by this article: [How to Fuzz an ADT Implementation](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/896).

When run as part of the unit test suite, the fuzz testers test a random chunk of bytes over a number of rounds. This means a unit test failure might be sporadic. The random seed (and glibc version if applicable) is printed to the command line when it starts so you can reproduce such failures. If you get a fuzz failure when running unit tests, record the seed and commit hash and file a bug report!

To fuzz test with american fuzzy lop, use `test/fuzz.sh` and choose a container or algorithm to test. Run it without arguments to get a list. You'll also need to do a bit of system configuration to make AFL happy on your system. The below assumes your system is Linux:

```sh
echo core | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern"
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
# echo ondemand to undo the above later
test/fuzz.sh test/build/afl/test_pottery_fuzz_vector
```

The test script prints out the afl command it uses so you can run it yourself if you want to configure it more (for example if you want to parallelize it.)

It can take days to sufficiently test a data structure so only do this if you really want to double check it (or if you just want to help me out in testing.) If you find anything please file a bug report!

The fuzz tests that currently exist are pretty minimal. They need to be expanded quite a bit to make them more useful.



## Benchmarks

Pottery includes a very simple benchmark harness for comparing the performance of algorithms and containers. The benchmarks only run on Linux.

Run the benchmarks with `test/benchmark.sh` . It will download a handful of competing libraries, build them into a benchmark suite and run it.

Currently only a handful of sorting algorithms are supported, and it only sorts random ints, not any interesting patterns. The benchmark prints the time taken for each algorithm; lower is better.
