/*
 * Wraps Pottery's heap_sort in a C++ template.
 *
 * Use pottery::heap_sort() as a mostly drop-in replacement for std::sort()
 * with a few caveats:
 *
 * - Heap sort has safe worst case behaviour and relatively small code size but
 *   is generally much slower than quick sort or intro sort on large arrays due
 *   to poor cache locality. pottery::intro_sort() or your platform's
 *   std::sort() is likely faster with the same worst case time complexity.
 *
 * - Throwing move and throwing swap are not supported. If a move constructor
 *   or swap throws, the program aborts. It is strongly recommended that your
 *   move constructor be marked noexcept.
 *
 * This may be useful for small to medium size arrays where you want consistent
 * performance and guaranteed time bounds.
