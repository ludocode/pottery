/*
 * This file includes all dependencies needed by Pottery templates.
 *
 * It is included automatically when instantiating any Pottery template.
 * However, in C++, this will trigger a compiler error if a template is
 * instantiated outside of file scope (i.e. in a class, namespace or extern "C"
 * block.) To include a Pottery template in a non-file scope, you must first
 * include this dependencies header at file scope.
