/*
 * Wraps Pottery's shell_sort in a C++ template.
 *
 * Use pottery::shell_sort() as a mostly drop-in replacement for std::sort()
 * with a few caveats:
 *
 * - The algorithm has greater worst-case complexity than that promised by
 *   std::sort(). (The actual worst case complexity of Ciura's gap sequence is
 *   not clear.)
 *
 * - Throwing move and throwing swap are not supported. If a move constructor
 *   or swap throws, the program aborts. It is strongly recommended that your
 *   move constructor be marked noexcept.
