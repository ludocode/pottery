This is an implementation of [Introsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort). It is intended to be competitive with a typical implementation of C++ `std::sort`. It is generally faster and safer to use than `qsort()`, with the downside of larger compiled code size.

Documentation still needs to be written. In the meantime, see the example [sort\_strings](../../../examples/pottery/sort_strings/).
