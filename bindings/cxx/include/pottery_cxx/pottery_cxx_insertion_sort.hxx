/*
 * Wraps Pottery's insertion_sort in a C++ template.
 *
 * Use pottery::insertion_sort() as a mostly drop-in replacement for std::sort()
 * for very small arrays with a few caveats:
 *
 * - The algorithm has a worst-case complexity of O(n^2), much worse than
 *   std::sort();
 *
 * - Throwing move and throwing swap are not supported. If a move constructor
 *   or swap throws, the program aborts. It is strongly recommended that your
 *   move constructor be marked noexcept.
 *
 * This could be useful for very small arrays since it results in a much
 * smaller code size than std::sort. It's also a stable sort and it's optimal
 * on arrays that are already mostly sorted. It's probably not wise to use this
 * on arrays of more than a hundred or so elements.
