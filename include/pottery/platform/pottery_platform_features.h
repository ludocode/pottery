/*
 * Debug
 */

/*
 * POTTERY_DEBUG enables lightweight assertions in Pottery suitable for debug
 * builds of your application. It detects most debug builds automatically.
 *
 * If an assertion in Pottery is triggered, it is more likely that the bug is
 * in the code that uses Pottery rather than in Pottery itself. Some examples:
 *
 * - You may have attempted an out-of-bounds array access;
 *
 * - You may have attemped to dereference a non-existent ref;
 *
 * - You may have corrupted a map element by changing its key;
 *
 * - Your comparison function may be intransitive or otherwise buggy;
 *
 * - Your hash or comparison function may have changed its results based on
 *   some external context without rebuilding the data structure that uses it.
 *
 * If you are hitting an assertion and you are sure you are using Pottery
 * correctly, please file a bug!

/*
 * POTTERY_LEAK_CHECK additionally enables extra leak check allocations for
 * objects that require explicit destruction. This can be useful to detect when
 * you've forgotten to destroy objects that might not otherwise cause an
 * external leak detector to notice.
 *
 * For example if you forget to destroy a vector that was only using internal
 * space, you didn't technically leak memory so a leak detector like ASAN or
 * Valgrind won't detect it, but it'll start leaking as soon as you put enough
 * stuff in it to make it allocate.
 *
 * This is off by default because it requires ordinary malloc() and free()
 * (since we need it before we've set up alloc contexts), it can be annoying
 * (seeing tons of 1 byte allocations in your memory tools), and it can slow
 * down debug builds too much.
 *
 * A better way might be to instrument the code to inform your tool directly
 * when Pottery's objects are created and destroyed. We don't really want to
 * instrument Pottery with every tool under the sun, but it might make sense
 * for some (and it would be nice if it detected more stuff, e.g. out-of-bounds
 * accesses for unused capacity in a vector.) In the meantime this is a bit of
 * a blunt hammer that can detect mismatched init/destroy with any memory
 * checker.
